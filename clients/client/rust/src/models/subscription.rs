A subscription in this state can only have metadata and default_source updated. Once the first invoice is paid, the subscription moves into an `active` state. If the first invoice is not paid within 23 hours, the subscription transitions to `incomplete_expired`. This is a terminal state, the open invoice will be voided and no further invoices will be generated.  A subscription that is currently in a trial period is `trialing` and moves to `active` when the trial period is over.  If subscription `collection_method=charge_automatically` it becomes `past_due` when payment to renew it fails and `canceled` or `unpaid` (depending on your subscriptions settings) when Stripe has exhausted all payment retry attempts.  If subscription `collection_method=send_invoice` it becomes `past_due` when its invoice is not paid by the due date, and `canceled` or `unpaid` if it is still not paid by an additional deadline after that. Note that when a subscription has a status of `unpaid`, no subsequent invoices will be attempted (invoices will be created, but then immediately automatically closed). After receiving updated payment information from a customer, you may choose to reopen and pay their closed invoices.
